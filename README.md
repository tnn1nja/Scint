### Play random sounds at random intervals to break up silences.

This a simple solo project to create a specific piece of software for my friend <br>
when hosting DnD Games. However, if you have use for a piece of software <br>
that creates sounds at random intervals feel free to
use this one.

It can be configured to play any MP3s you'd like.

Enjoy.
